# Voice-GAN
These are the results for Spectrogram-GAN voice transformation

The speaker one is represented as A and speaker two is represented as B. 

-AB is the transformed result of convert the voice of speaker A to speaker B. <br>
-BA is the transformed result of convert the voice of speaker B to speaker A. <br>
-ABA is the twice transformed result of convert AB (the converted the voice of speaker B from speaker A) to the voice of speaker A again. <br>
-BAB is the twice transformed result of convert BA (the converted the voice of speaker A from speaker B) to the voice of speaker B again. <br>
